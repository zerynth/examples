ADC Analog to Digital Acquisition Basics 
==================================================

The function for Analog to Digital convertion in ZERYNTH is adc.read()

The complete definition is adc.read(pin, samples=1) 

In this example simple ADC single pin acquisition and advanced multi sample ADC acquisition are reported.

In ZERYNTH ADC is also available as builtin analogRead() with the same signature of adc.read(). analogRead() is available only for compatibility with the Arduino world and will be deprecated in future versions of ZERYNTH.
