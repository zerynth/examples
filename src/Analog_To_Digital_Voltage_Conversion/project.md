ADC Analog to Digital Acquisition with Voltage Conversion
=========================================================
This basic examples shows how to read an analog voltage from pin 0, converts it to the corresponding voltage, and prints the result to the serial monitor.
To test it user can attach the center pin of a potentiometer to pin A0, and the other pins respectively to to +3.3V and GND.
